# ReduxCourse
This is the code that I created going through the Udemy's Course: "[Aprende Redux Facilmente](https://www.udemy.com/course/aprende-redux-facilmente/)" by [Hector BlisS](https://github.com/HectorBlisS)

## Installation
  - Clone the repo
  - Run `npm install`

## Usage
  - Open index.html on your browser
  - If you want to make changes, run `npx webpack --watch` so webpack can know when you make changes on main.js

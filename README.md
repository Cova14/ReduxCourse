# ReduxCourse
This is the code that I created going through the Udemy's Course: "[Aprende Redux Facilmente](https://www.udemy.com/course/aprende-redux-facilmente/)" by [Hector BlisS](https://github.com/HectorBlisS)

## Installation
Before this, you should have installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
Once you've done this, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) should be installed automatically. 

You can check if they were installed correctly by running on your console: `node --version` & `npm --version`. You should see something like this: 
```
$ node --version
v10.16.1

$ npm --version
6.9.0
```
Once this is done:
  - Clone the repo
  - Run `npm install`

## Usage
  - Open index.html on your browser
  - If you want to make changes, run `npx webpack --watch` so webpack can know when you make changes on main.js
  - Have fun with your own tests!
